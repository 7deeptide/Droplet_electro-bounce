	abstract = {Charges induced on drops formed by dispensing small masses from a source liquid in the region of an electrostatic field have been measured. The induced charge was found to be proportional to the voltage applied to a ring electrode positioned coaxially with the liquid jet from which the drops are formed. The measured values were in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Charges induced on drops in a regular procession were calculated from current measurements and the drop production frequency. The charge transported by the drops is read directly from a calibrated meter.},
