- [x] Find contact time with ellipse fit parameters
- [x] Check filtering dt --> resample with fft, or use a spline fit to make the data and time lists the same length
- [x] Add partitioning based on contact time --> make (greater/less than) minm a boolean mask and add to the contact mask
- [] Count number of partitions, add acceleration plots for each
- [] Finish functionalizing the munging
- [] Add analytical functions for Re, tj vs. We
- [x] Add absolute criteria for YM zero --> still need a plan for non-bounce ref. points
- [] check savgol docs for suitability of other interpolation modes

- [] Add numerical derivatives of del.E^2 for dielectrophoresis
- [] Plot all simulation forces on same (log) axis
- [] Review parameter estimation - expected variance
