The induced charge was found to be proportional to the voltage applied to a ring electrode positioned coaxially with the liquid jet from which the drops are formed. The measured values were in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Charges induced on drops in a regular procession were calculated from current measurements and the drop production frequency. The charge transported by the drops is read directly from a calibrated meter.},

In that work, capillarity-driven flows leading to unique spontaneous droplet ejections, bubble ingestions, and multiphase flows were introduced and discussed. Such efforts are continued herein. The spontaneous droplet ejection phenomena (auto-ejection) is reviewed and demonstrated on earth as well as aboard the International Space Station. This technique is then applied to novel low-g droplet combustion where soot tube structures are created in the wakes of burning drops. A variety of new tests are presented that routinely demonstrate ‘puddle jumping,’ a process defined as the spontaneous recoil and ejection of large liquid drops from hydrophobic surfaces following the step reduction in ‘gravity’ characteristic of most drop towers. The inverse problem of ‘bubble jumping’ is also demonstrated for the case of hydrophilic surfaces. A variety of puddle jump demonstrations are presented in summary as a means of suggesting the further exploitation of drop towers to study such large length scale capillary phenomena.},

	abstract = {When an electrostatic field is applied to a medium, an electric force arises, originated by polarization and by the possible presence of free charge. If the medium is a two-phase fluid, this force drives the vapor (of lower dielectric permittivity) towards the zone of weaker electric field, giving the opportunity of separating phases and enhancing boiling heat transfer in microgravity conditions, where buoyancy is lacking. Electric force is also responsible for bubble deformation. In this paper, after a comprehensive description of electro-hydro-dynamics (EHD) mechanisms in a two-phase fluid, some relevant literature data about EHD-induced phase separation are reported, confirming the effectiveness of the technique. The electric force on a growing and rising bubble is then evaluated numerically in some simple cases, with a fem technique. Finally, original experiments on gas bubble detachment are analyzed in the attempt to enucleate the role of different mechanisms contributing to EHD enhancement. In particular, it is stressed that the role of electric forces in altering bubble shape and increasing bubble internal pressure seems to be the most significant in promoting bubble detachment.},

Settling rockets have been used to orient the liquid and vapor in present-day venting applications, but these affect vehicle guidance and are excessively heavy for any but very low acceleration levels and settling times. It is important, therefore, to develop more efficient methods for venting vapor.},

Some important aspects of EHD coupled heat-transfer enhancement including a succinct set of conditions that define the various regimes are reviewed. Specific application of the complex electrohydrodynamic mechanisms involved in EHD coupled heat transfer in liquids is considered. Potential applications of EHD heat transfer include general enhancement of pool boiling for heat exchanger equipment. Certain advantages and disadvantages of EHD coupled heat transfer in low temperature and cryogenic high-voltage cables should be assessed. The boiling and condensation heat transfer and basic configuration of an EHD heat pipe using electromechanical flow structure to promote condensate return flow are diagrammatically represented.

In such a way, it was possible to investigate the mechanical effects in bubble dynamics separately from the thermal and mass exchange ones involved in boiling. An electric field of nearly cylindrical geometry was generated around the tube by imposing a D.C. potential drop V (0–18 kV) to a eight-rod cylindrical “squirrel cage” surrounding it. The apparatus was operated in microgravity conditions in the dropshaft of JAMIC in Hokkaido, Japan. Bubble size, detachment frequency and velocity were measured by digital processing of high-speed video images. The results showed that in the absence of electric field bubble detachment did not take place at low gas flow rate; conversely at higher gas flow, the dynamical effects were sufficient to induce bubble detachment even in the absence of the buoyant force. The application of electric field was confirmed to be effective in promoting bubble detachment at values of diameter greater but of the same order of magnitude as in normal gravity, and in providing a force to remove the bubbles away from the orifice.},

The theory is used to consider DEP trapping, electrorotation, traveling-wave induced motion, and orientational effects. The effective dipole method, and its generalization to effective multipoles, makes it possible to treat multilayered concentric shells and particles exhibiting ohmic and dielectric loss. This method may be extended further to the case of nonspherical particles, where alignment torques can be considered. These capabilities are well suited to modeling DEP behavior of biological particles including cells. The models and methods presented in this review are sufficiently general to be of use in a broad range of applications for biological dielectrophoresis and particle electrokinetics. The range of validity can be stated confidently to cover particles having diameters approximately 1μm and larger.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of the decay of the surface potential of corona-charged untreated polyethylene films 25 mu m thick in air have been investigated using a well-defined circular charging area and a high-resolution 80 mu m diameter induction probe. Distinct differences between the decay characteristics of negative and positive surface charges emerge. In the former case, the nature of the decay is shown to depend not only on the magnitude of the surface potential (700-3000 V) but also on the presence of the corona light. Corona light incident on the centre of the exposed area during charging subsequently leads to a much more rapid decay of charge in this region. In contrast, corona light has no effect on the subsequent decay of positive charges which appears to decay very much in accordance with known theories. The corona light is shown to be responsible for the so-called 'cross-over' phenomena which hitherto has been observed, notably by Ieda and co-workers (1967, 1968) after positive charging.},

Theoretical interpretation of the experimental results gives conductivities, or mobilities, and charge carrier concentrations, depending on the technique applied. The decay of surface charge is not exponential and so the half-life of the decay is not readily related to the relaxation time constant ϵ/σ.

By employing electret as a virtual voltage source embedded into microfluidics for the first time, a dielectric droplet between two electrodes can be transported by liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) force when switching an external capacitor between electrodes using a manual switch or low-voltage-driven relays. A circuit model and force analysis for L-DEPOE are established to clarify its working principle and quantitatively depict the droplet motion. Nanoliter dielectric droplets have been transported reversibly between the two electrodes with a manual switch or five DCV-driven relays in microfabricated proof-of-concept prototypes. The surface voltage stability of electret in liquid is examined with different polymer materials and coatings. Furthermore, the droplet motion traces in a L-DEPOE device are compared with numerical simulation results, indicating the important role of contact angle hysteresis for nanoliter droplets.},

Reasons for the choice of design are outlined, and a formal procedure given. The performance of the technique in the presence and absence of error is studied and it is shown (a) that in the presence of error the rate of advance is inversely proportional to the error standard deviation, so that replication of observations is not beneficial, and (b) that the “efficiency” of the technique appears to increase in direct proportion to the number of factors investigated. It is also noted that, since the direction of movement from each simplex is dependent solely on the ranking of the observations, the technique may be used even in circumstances when a response cannot be quantitatively assessed. Attention is drawn to the ease with which second-order designs having the minimum number of experimental points may be derived from a regular simplex, and a fitting procedure which avoids a direct matrix inversion is suggested. In a brief appendix one or two new rotatable designs derivable from a simplex are noted.},

However, due to the advancement of semiconductor industries, ultrapure water has been used for washing and rinsing processes and it turned out that high degree of electrification might be produced by using such ultrapure water. In order to clarify this phenomenon, the electrification of deionized water droplets dripping to and sliding on a polymer (PTFE) surface has been investigated. The surface potential distribution of the polymer plate after electrification is measured by moving a probe for two-dimensional scanning. The charge amount of the droplets after the sliding is measured by a Faraday cage. From these experiments, several interesting results were obtained. The potential distribution on the surface is not uniform, but varies along the streaming path. At the dripping point the surface potential of the polymer plate always becomes negative, then turns to positive downstream. However, the droplet, after sliding on the polymer surface, becomes electrified positively. This electrification phenomenon depends on the velocity and the conductivity of droplets. In order to explain this electrification process, a model based on the electric double layer is proposed.},

Due to our singular experience with terrestrial systems, artificial body forces are often imparted in multiphase fluid systems aboard spacecraft to reproduce the buoyancy effect. This approach tends to be inefficient, adding complexity, resources, and failure modes. Ever present in multiphase phenomena, the forces of surface tension can be exploited to aid passive phase separations where performance characteristics are determined solely by geometric design and system wettability. Said systems may be readily designed as demonstrated herein where a regulated bubbly flow is drawn through an open triangular sectioned duct. The bubbles passively migrate toward the free surface where they coalesce and leave the flow. The tests clearly show container aspect ratios required for passive phase separations for various liquid and gas flow rates. Preliminary data are presented as regime maps demarking complete phase separation. Long duration microgravity experiments are performed aboard the International Space Station.

Miljkovic \textit{et al.} find that this process also causes the droplets to become charged, enabling them to be manipulated with an electric field.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The mechanism and participants in the charge transfer (electrons or ions), although widely investigated, are still controversial. Whereas the identity of the charge carrier cannot be distinguished by electrostatic measurements, we have recently found that charges on a dielectric surface, e.g. for polymers like Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE) and Lucite [poly(methylmethacrylate) or (PMMA)], can carry out different chemical redox reactions, e.g. metal deposition, ion reduction, and chemiluminescence. This suggests that electron transfer occurs in electrification. This chemical approach allows determination of the surface density of electronic charge as well as processes involved in charging and discharging the dielectrics. An overview of this work is presented.},

When atmospheric drag is introduced, the simulated motion closely mimics that seen in the video footage of the experiment. The electrostatic force's inverse dependency on separation distance near the center of the needle lends itself to analytic predictions of the radial motion.},

Radiative performance of a droplet sheet is considered, and experimental results are seen to be in very good agreement with analytical predictions. The collision of droplets in the droplet sheet, the charging of droplets by the space plasma, and the effect of atmospheric drag on the droplet sheet are shown to be of little consequence, or can be minimized by proper design. The LDR is seen to be less susceptible than conventional technology to the effects of micrometeoroids or hostile threats. The identification of working fluids which are stable in the orbital environments of interest is also made. Methods for reducing spacecraft contamination from an LDR to an acceptable level are discussed. Preliminary results of microgravity testing of the droplet generator are presented. Possible future NASA and Air Force missions enhanced or enabled by a LDR are also discussed. System studies indicate that the LDR is potentially less massive than heat pipe radiators. Planned microgravity testing aboard the Shuttle or space station is seen to be a logical next step in LDR development.},

	title = {The {Charging} of {Composites} in the {Space} {Environment}},
	url = {https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19970033626},
	abstract = {Deep dielectric charging and subsequent electrostatic discharge in composite materials used on spacecraft have become greater concerns since composite materials are being used more extensively as main structural components. Deep dielectric charging occurs when high energy particles penetrate and deposit themselves in the insulating material of spacecraft components. These deposited particles induce an electric field in the material, which causes the particles to move and thus changes the electric field. The electric field continues to change until a steady state is reached between the incoming particles from the space environment and the particles moving away due to the electric field. An electrostatic discharge occurs when the electric field is greater than the dielectric strength of the composite material. The goal of the current investigation is to investigate deep dielectric charging in composite materials and ascertain what modifications have to be made to the composite properties to alleviate any breakdown issues. A 1-D model was created. The space environment, which is calculated using the Environmental Workbench software, the composite material properties, and the electric field and voltage boundary conditions are input into the model. The output from the model is the charge density, electric field, and voltage distributions as functions of the depth into the material and time. Analysis using the model show that there should be no deep dielectric charging problem with conductive composites such as carbon fiber/epoxy. With insulating materials such as glass fiber/epoxy, Kevlar, and polymers, there is also no concern of deep dielectric charging problems with average day-to-day particle fluxes. However, problems can arise during geomagnetic substorms and solar particle events where particle flux levels increase by several orders of magnitude, and thus increase the electric field in the material by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the second part of this investigation was an experimental attempt to measure the continuum electrical properties of a carbon fiber/epoxy composite, and to create a composite with tailorable conductivity without affecting its mechanical properties. The measurement of the conductivity and dielectric strength of carbon fiber/epoxy composites showed that these properties are surface layer dominated and difficult to measure. In the second experimental task, the conductivity of a glass fiber/epoxy composite was increased by 3 orders of magnitude, dielectric constant was increased approximately by a factor of 16, with minimal change to the mechanical properties, by adding conductive carbon black to the epoxy.},

Douglas MacGregor claimed that PTFE electret works as a means of ions separation for desalination due to the polarization of an electrolyte and ions migration under a permanent electrostatic field generated by a pair of electrets with opposite polarities. The electrostatic field attracts counter-ions to the charged solid surface, and thus generates a purified effluent in the mainstream. Theoretical and experimental analyses were made to investigate the practicality of desalination by electret technology. It is found that MacGregor's design is meaningful only for a dilute electrolyte or a system with very high surface charge density because the number of the counter-ions attracted to the surface is limited and cannot exceed that of the surface charges at the electret.},

The effect of these properties on the retention of pesticide sprays has been examined by a study of the sliding of drops of water and solutions of surfactants on wax and cellulose acetate surfaces. A theory, supported by experimental results, has been evolved to explain the movement of drops in terms of the size of the drop, the angle of tilt of the surface, the air/liquid surface tension, and the advancing and receding contact angles. This theory has been developed to predict the volume of spray liquid that will be retained on a solid surface. The retentions found in practice agree well with the theoretical figures for most of the spray/solid combinations examined under comparable conditions of spray droplet impaction. A slight modification of the theory permits the correction of some anomalous results obtained with easily wetted surfaces. A retention factor F for any spray liquid/solid combination may be calculated to predict the degree of retention of the liquid on the solid. This factor may be simplified, without undue loss of accuracy, to the form: F = θM[γAL(cos θR - cos θA)/ρ]12, where •θA is the advancing contact angle;•θR is the receding contact angle;•θM is the arithmetic mean of θA and θR;•γal is the air/liquid surface tension; and•ρ is the density of the spray liquid. The use of such a retention factor facilitates the study of the formulation of spray fluids.},

	abstract = {Direct search methods are best known as unconstrained optimization techniques that do not explicitly use derivatives. Direct search methods were formally proposed and widely applied in the 1960s but fell out of favor with the mathematical optimization community by the early 1970s because they lacked coherent mathematical analysis. Nonetheless, users remained loyal to these methods, most of which were easy to program, some of which were reliable. In the past fifteen years, these methods have seen a revival due, in part, to the appearance of mathematical analysis, as well as to interest in parallel and distributed computing. This review begins by briefly summarizing the history of direct search methods and considering the special properties of problems for which they are well suited. Our focus then turns to a broad class of methods for which we provide a unifying framework that lends itself to a variety of convergence results. The underlying principles allow generalization to handle bound constraints and linear constraints. We also discuss extensions to problems with nonlinear constraints.},

	abstract = {The Nelder–Mead algorithm (1965) for unconstrained optimization has been used extensively to solve parameter estimation and other problems. Despite its age, it is still the method of choice for many practitioners in the fields of statistics, engineering, and the physical and medical sciences because it is easy to code and very easy to use. It belongs to a class of methods which do not require derivatives and which are often claimed to be robust for problems with discontinuities or where the function values are noisy. Recently (1998), it has been shown that the method can fail to converge or converge to nonsolutions on certain classes of problems. Only very limited convergence results exist for a restricted class of problems in one or two dimensions. In this paper, a provably convergent variant of the Nelder–Mead simplex method is presented and analyzed. Numerical results are included to show that the modified algorithm is effective in practice.},

	abstract = {We study the head-on collision between two weakly deformable droplets, each of
radius a (in the range 10–150 μm), moving towards one another with characteristic
impact speeds ±U′c. The liquid comprising the drop has
density ρd and viscosity μd.
The collision takes place in an incompressible continuum gas with ambient density
ρg [Lt ] ρd, ambient pressure p′∞
and viscosity μg [Lt ] μd The gas–liquid interface is
surfactant free with interfacial tension σ. The Weber number based on the drop density,
Wed ≡
ρdU′2ca/σ [Lt ] 1
and the capillary number based on the gas viscosity, Cagg ≡
μgU′cσ [Lt ] 1.
The Reynolds number characterizing flow inside the drops satisfies Red ≡
aU′cρd/μd [Gt ]
We1/2d and the Stokes number characterizing the drop inertia,
St ≡ 2Wed(9Cag)−1 ≡
2(ρdU′caμ−1g)/9
is O(1) or larger.We first analyse a simple model for the rebound process which is valid when
St [Gt ] 1 and viscous dissipation in both the gas and in the drop can be neglected.
We assume that the film separating the drops only serves to keep the interfaces
from touching by supplying a constant excess pressure 2σ/a. A singular perturbation
analysis reveals that when ln(We−1/4d) [Gt ] 1, rebound occurs on a time
scale t′b =
\&23frac;1/2πaWe1/2dln1/2
(We−1/4d)U′−1c.
Numerical results for Weber numbers in the range
O(10−6) − O(10−1)
compare very well to existing experimental and simulation results,
indicating that the approximate treatment of the bounce process is applicable for
Wed {\textless} 0:3.In the second part of the paper we formulate a general theory that not only
models the flow inside the drop but also takes into account the evolution of the
gap width separating the drops. The drop deformation in the near-contact inner
region is determined by solving the lubrication equations and matching to an outer
solution. The resulting equations are solved numerically using a direct, semi-implicit,
matrix inversion technique for capillary numbers in the range 10−8 to 10−4 and
Stokes numbers from 2 to 200. Trajectories are mapped out in terms of Cag and the
parameter χ = (Wed/Cag)1/2 so that
St ≡ 2/9χ2. For small Stokes numbers, the drops
behave as nearly rigid spheres and come to rest without any significant rebound.
For O(1) Stokes numbers, the surfaces deform noticeably and a dimple forms when
the gap thickness is approximately O(aCa1/2). The dimple extent increases, reaches
a maximum and then decreases to zero. Meanwhile, the centroids of the two drops
come to rest momentarily and then the drops rebound, executing oscillatory motions
before finally coming to rest. As the Stokes number increases with Cag held fixed,
more energy is stored as deformation energy and the maximum radial extent of the
dimple increases accordingly. For St [Gt ] 1, no oscillations in the centroid positions
are observed, but the temporal evolution of the minimum gap thickness exhibits two
minima. One minimum occurs during the dimple evolution process and corresponds
to the minimum attained by the dimple rim. The second minimum occurs along the
axis of symmetry when the dimple relaxes, a tail forms and then retracts. A detailed
analysis of the interface shapes, pressure profiles and the force acting on the drops
allows us to obtain a complete picture of the collision and rebound process.},

Most proposed collectors are meshes that rely on inertial collision for droplet capture and are inherently limited by aerodynamics. We propose a new approach in which we introduce electrical forces that can overcome aerodynamic drag forces. Using an ion emitter, we introduce a space charge into the fog to impart a net charge to the incoming fog droplets and direct them toward a collector using an imposed electric field. We experimentally measure the collection efficiency on single wires, two-wire systems, and meshes and propose a physical model to quantify it. We identify the regimes of optimal collection and provide insights into designing effective fog harvesting systems.
We drastically increase fog harvesting efficiency using space charge injection and electrostatic driving forces.

	abstract = {The Microgravity Science Glovebox  on the International Space Station  is used for fluid transfer in many types of experiments. Reagents are handled in the MSG to prevent their accidental release into the cabin. However, the MSG is currently over-subscribed, creating a backlog of users in flight. As a recourse, current experiments are underway to assess the possibility of moving certain science operations from the MSG into the open cabin of the ISS. The experiments are designed to assess the efficacy of exploiting surface tension as a control to prevent the unwanted release of liquids. Dyed water currently serves as an ersatz for potentially more hazardous liquids. Common wet-lab operations such as de/mating wetted Luer-Lok fittings, liquid-bearing container lid removal, and pipetting between well plates are performed illustrating the facility and challenges imposed by the microgravity environment. Concerning the latter, various pipette cannula sizes are deployed at various injection, withdrawal, and translations rates to map the existence, size, velocity, and trajectory of satellite droplets expected to form when breaking contact between the water surface and the pipette tip. Though such drops frequently form in terrestrial operations, they are nearly imperceptible and inconsequentialâ€”due in part to their speed and because gravity quickly returns them to the well plate from which they came. The use of airflow to capture and collect such satellite droplets is demonstrated. The dynamic stability of the liquid-filled well plates is quantified in response to a variety of crew-imparted disturbances. From a safety perspective, the results from the STCE are of immediate practical value. If such routine low-gravity capillary fluidic operations can be established as mundane, their performance may be moved out of the MSG and into the cabin, significantly increasing the efficiency of experiments performed on ISS.},

	abstract = {Electrohydrodynamics deals with fluid motion induced by electric fields. In the mid 1960s GI Taylor introduced the leaky dielectric model to explain the behavior of droplets deformed by a steady field, and JR Melcher used it extensively to develop electrohydrodynamics. This review deals with the foundations of the leaky dielectric model and experimental tests designed to probe its usefulness. Although the early experimental studies supported the qualitative features of the model, quantitative agreement was poor. Recent studies are in better agreement with the theory. Even though the model was originally intended to deal with sharp interfaces, contemporary studies with suspensions also agree with the theory. Clearly the leaky dielectric model is more general than originally envisioned.},
