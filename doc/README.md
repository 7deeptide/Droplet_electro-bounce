- **Descriptive statistics**, source of variation for parallel plates deflection (e.g. the explained variation in the linear regression model). Should be applied to the bounce experiements as well, cen use maximum -likelyhood parameter estimation from the model, or use the parameter optimization scheme. Chi-squared statistic to compare measured pdf from the sampled data to the theoretical density function.
- **Data Structures** Create HDF5 files from the particle tracking output csv's with *pytables* and tag them with experiemental metadata.
- Create functions for rest of analysis workflow (instead of one-off scripts).
