	abstract = {A variety of contemplative demonstrations concerning intermediate-to-large length scale capillary fluidic phenomena were made possible by the brief weightless environment of a drop tower (Wollman and Weislogel in Exp Fluids 54(4):1, 2013). In that work, capillarity-driven flows leading to unique spontaneous droplet ejections, bubble ingestions, and multiphase flows were introduced and discussed. Such efforts are continued herein. The spontaneous droplet ejection phenomena (auto-ejection) is reviewed and demonstrated on earth as well as aboard the International Space Station. This technique is then applied to novel low-g droplet combustion where soot tube structures are created in the wakes of burning drops. A variety of new tests are presented that routinely demonstrate ‘puddle jumping,’ a process defined as the spontaneous recoil and ejection of large liquid drops from hydrophobic surfaces following the step reduction in ‘gravity’ characteristic of most drop towers. The inverse problem of ‘bubble jumping’ is also demonstrated for the case of hydrophilic surfaces. A variety of puddle jump demonstrations are presented in summary as a means of suggesting the further exploitation of drop towers to study such large length scale capillary phenomena.},

	abstract = {When an electrostatic field is applied to a medium, an electric force arises, originated by polarization and by the possible presence of free charge. If the medium is a two-phase fluid, this force drives the vapor (of lower dielectric permittivity) towards the zone of weaker electric field, giving the opportunity of separating phases and enhancing boiling heat transfer in microgravity conditions, where buoyancy is lacking. Electric force is also responsible for bubble deformation. In this paper, after a comprehensive description of electro-hydro-dynamics ({EHD}) mechanisms in a two-phase fluid, some relevant literature data about {EHD}-induced phase separation are reported, confirming the effectiveness of the technique. The electric force on a growing and rising bubble is then evaluated numerically in some simple cases, with a fem technique. Finally, original experiments on gas bubble detachment are analyzed in the attempt to enucleate the role of different mechanisms contributing to {EHD} enhancement. In particular, it is stressed that the role of electric forces in altering bubble shape and increasing bubble internal pressure seems to be the most significant in promoting bubble detachment.},

Settling rockets have been used to orient the liquid and vapor in present-day venting applications, but these affect vehicle guidance and are excessively heavy for any but very low acceleration levels and settling times. It is important, therefore, to develop more efficient methods for venting vapor.},

Specific application of the complex electrohydrodynamic mechanisms involved in {EHD} coupled heat transfer in liquids is considered. Potential applications of {EHD} heat transfer include general enhancement of pool boiling for heat exchanger equipment.

In such a way, it was possible to investigate the mechanical effects in bubble dynamics separately from the thermal and mass exchange ones involved in boiling. An electric field of nearly cylindrical geometry was generated around the tube by imposing a D.C. potential drop V (0–18 {kV}) to a eight-rod cylindrical “squirrel cage” surrounding it. The apparatus was operated in microgravity conditions in the dropshaft of {JAMIC} in Hokkaido, Japan. Bubble size, detachment frequency and velocity were measured by digital processing of high-speed video images. The results showed that in the absence of electric field bubble detachment did not take place at low gas flow rate; conversely at higher gas flow, the dynamical effects were sufficient to induce bubble detachment even in the absence of the buoyant force. The application of electric field was confirmed to be effective in promoting bubble detachment at values of diameter greater but of the same order of magnitude as in normal gravity, and in providing a force to remove the bubbles away from the orifice.},

The theory is used to consider {DEP} trapping, electrorotation, traveling-wave induced motion, and orientational effects. The effective dipole method, and its generalization to effective multipoles, makes it possible to treat multilayered concentric shells and particles exhibiting ohmic and dielectric loss. This method may be extended further to the case of nonspherical particles, where alignment torques can be considered. These capabilities are well suited to modeling {DEP} behavior of biological particles including cells. The models and methods presented in this review are sufficiently general to be of use in a broad range of applications for biological dielectrophoresis and particle electrokinetics. The range of validity can be stated confidently to cover particles having diameters approximately 1μm and larger.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the surface potential decay of corona-charged low density polyethylene ({LDPE}) films has been investigated. It has been found that for the same sample thickness the faster decay occurs in the sample with a higher charging voltage. For the same charging voltage, the surface potential in the thinner sample shows rapid decay. Our new evidence from both the surface potential measurement on multilayer samples and space charge measurement suggests the surface potential decay is a bulk limited process. More importantly, space charge measurement indicates double injection has taken place during corona charging process.},

Distinct differences between the decay characteristics of negative and positive surface charges emerge. In the former case, the nature of the decay is shown to depend not only on the magnitude of the surface potential (700-3000 V) but also on the presence of the corona light. Corona light incident on the centre of the exposed area during charging subsequently leads to a much more rapid decay of charge in this region. In contrast, corona light has no effect on the subsequent decay of positive charges which appears to decay very much in accordance with known theories. The corona light is shown to be responsible for the so-called 'cross-over' phenomena which hitherto has been observed, notably by Ieda and co-workers (1967, 1968) after positive charging.},

To produce the surface charges, two different charging techniques were applied. One method utilised electrodes attached to the surface of the sample, the other consisted of the use of an ionisator (corona charging). Theoretical interpretation of the experimental results gives conductivities, or mobilities, and charge carrier concentrations, depending on the technique applied. The decay of surface charge is not exponential and so the half-life of the decay is not readily related to the relaxation time constant ϵ/σ. Herein is ϵ=ϵ0ϵr the total dielectric constant and σ the conductivity.},

	abstract = {In order to make droplet-based digital microfluidics really 'digital' and compatible with standard integrated chips ({ICs}), a novel low-voltage droplet manipulation method named 'liquid dielectrophoresis on electret (L-{DEPOE})' is proposed for dielectric liquids, which initializes the possibility of digital microfluidics for {IC} control and broad consumer electronic applications. By employing electret as a virtual voltage source embedded into microfluidics for the first time, a dielectric droplet between two electrodes can be transported by liquid dielectrophoresis (L-{DEP}) force when switching an external capacitor between electrodes using a manual switch or low-voltage-driven relays. A circuit model and force analysis for L-{DEPOE} are established to clarify its working principle and quantitatively depict the droplet motion. Nanoliter dielectric droplets have been transported reversibly between the two electrodes with a manual switch or five {DCV}-driven relays in microfabricated proof-of-concept prototypes. The surface voltage stability of electret in liquid is examined with different polymer materials and coatings. Furthermore, the droplet motion traces in a L-{DEPOE} device are compared with numerical simulation results, indicating the important role of contact angle hysteresis for nanoliter droplets.},

Reasons for the choice of design are outlined, and a formal procedure given. The performance of the technique in the presence and absence of error is studied and it is shown (a) that in the presence of error the rate of advance is inversely proportional to the error standard deviation, so that replication of observations is not beneficial, and (b) that the “efficiency” of the technique appears to increase in direct proportion to the number of factors investigated. It is also noted that, since the direction of movement from each simplex is dependent solely on the ranking of the observations, the technique may be used even in circumstances when a response cannot be quantitatively assessed. Attention is drawn to the ease with which second-order designs having the minimum number of experimental points may be derived from a regular simplex, and a fitting procedure which avoids a direct matrix inversion is suggested. In a brief appendix one or two new rotatable designs derivable from a simplex are noted.},

In the mid 1960s {GI} Taylor introduced the leaky dielectric model to explain the behavior of droplets deformed by a steady field, and {JR} Melcher used it extensively to develop electrohydrodynamics. This review deals with the foundations of the leaky dielectric model and experimental tests designed to probe its usefulness. Although the early experimental studies supported the qualitative features of the model, quantitative agreement was poor. Recent studies are in better agreement with the theory. Even though the model was originally intended to deal with sharp interfaces, contemporary studies with suspensions also agree with the theory. Clearly the leaky dielectric model is more general than originally envisioned.},

By integrating the Maxwell stress tensor over the surface of a dielectric particle, we derive the general expressions for {DEP} force and {ROT} torque generated by electrical fields of arbitrary configuration. This is the first time that such complete expressions are derived from first principles using the {MST} formalism. The results are compared and shown to be in agreement with those obtained from the effective moment approach. The origin of {DEP} forces in a harmonic field is discussed in terms of field magnitude and phase distributions.},

	abstract = {The streaming electrification of pure water is generally thought to be a less problem because of its high conductivity which is six orders of magnitude higher than that of a hydrocarbon liquid. However, due to the advancement of semiconductor industries, ultrapure water has been used for washing and rinsing processes and it turned out that high degree of electrification might be produced by using such ultrapure water. In order to clarify this phenomenon, the electrification of deionized water droplets dripping to and sliding on a polymer ({PTFE}) surface has been investigated. The surface potential distribution of the polymer plate after electrification is measured by moving a probe for two-dimensional scanning. The charge amount of the droplets after the sliding is measured by a Faraday cage. From these experiments, several interesting results were obtained. The potential distribution on the surface is not uniform, but varies along the streaming path. At the dripping point the surface potential of the polymer plate always becomes negative, then turns to positive downstream. However, the droplet, after sliding on the polymer surface, becomes electrified positively. This electrification phenomenon depends on the velocity and the conductivity of droplets. In order to explain this electrification process, a model based on the electric double layer is proposed.},
