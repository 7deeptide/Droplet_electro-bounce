	abstract = {A variety of contemplative demonstrations concerning intermediate-to-large length scale capillary fluidic phenomena were made possible by the brief weightless environment of a drop tower (Wollman and Weislogel in Exp Fluids 54(4):1, 2013). In that work, capillarity-driven flows leading to unique spontaneous droplet ejections, bubble ingestions, and multiphase flows were introduced and discussed. Such efforts are continued herein. The spontaneous droplet ejection phenomena (auto-ejection) is reviewed and demonstrated on earth as well as aboard the International Space Station. This technique is then applied to novel low-g droplet combustion where soot tube structures are created in the wakes of burning drops. A variety of new tests are presented that routinely demonstrate ‘puddle jumping,’ a process defined as the spontaneous recoil and ejection of large liquid drops from hydrophobic surfaces following the step reduction in ‘gravity’ characteristic of most drop towers. The inverse problem of ‘bubble jumping’ is also demonstrated for the case of hydrophilic surfaces. A variety of puddle jump demonstrations are presented in summary as a means of suggesting the further exploitation of drop towers to study such large length scale capillary phenomena.},

	abstract = {When an electrostatic field is applied to a medium, an electric force arises, originated by polarization and by the possible presence of free charge. If the medium is a two-phase fluid, this force drives the vapor (of lower dielectric permittivity) towards the zone of weaker electric field, giving the opportunity of separating phases and enhancing boiling heat transfer in microgravity conditions, where buoyancy is lacking. Electric force is also responsible for bubble deformation. In this paper, after a comprehensive description of electro-hydro-dynamics ({EHD}) mechanisms in a two-phase fluid, some relevant literature data about {EHD}-induced phase separation are reported, confirming the effectiveness of the technique. The electric force on a growing and rising bubble is then evaluated numerically in some simple cases, with a fem technique. Finally, original experiments on gas bubble detachment are analyzed in the attempt to enucleate the role of different mechanisms contributing to {EHD} enhancement. In particular, it is stressed that the role of electric forces in altering bubble shape and increasing bubble internal pressure seems to be the most significant in promoting bubble detachment.},

Settling rockets have been used to orient the liquid and vapor in present-day venting applications, but these affect vehicle guidance and are excessively heavy for any but very low acceleration levels and settling times. It is important, therefore, to develop more efficient methods for venting vapor.},

Specific application of the complex electrohydrodynamic mechanisms involved in {EHD} coupled heat transfer in liquids is considered. Potential applications of {EHD} heat transfer include general enhancement of pool boiling for heat exchanger equipment.

In such a way, it was possible to investigate the mechanical effects in bubble dynamics separately from the thermal and mass exchange ones involved in boiling. An electric field of nearly cylindrical geometry was generated around the tube by imposing a D.C. potential drop V (0–18 {kV}) to a eight-rod cylindrical “squirrel cage” surrounding it. The apparatus was operated in microgravity conditions in the dropshaft of {JAMIC} in Hokkaido, Japan. Bubble size, detachment frequency and velocity were measured by digital processing of high-speed video images. The results showed that in the absence of electric field bubble detachment did not take place at low gas flow rate; conversely at higher gas flow, the dynamical effects were sufficient to induce bubble detachment even in the absence of the buoyant force. The application of electric field was confirmed to be effective in promoting bubble detachment at values of diameter greater but of the same order of magnitude as in normal gravity, and in providing a force to remove the bubbles away from the orifice.},

The theory is used to consider {DEP} trapping, electrorotation, traveling-wave induced motion, and orientational effects. The effective dipole method, and its generalization to effective multipoles, makes it possible to treat multilayered concentric shells and particles exhibiting ohmic and dielectric loss. This method may be extended further to the case of nonspherical particles, where alignment torques can be considered. These capabilities are well suited to modeling {DEP} behavior of biological particles including cells. The models and methods presented in this review are sufficiently general to be of use in a broad range of applications for biological dielectrophoresis and particle electrokinetics. The range of validity can be stated confidently to cover particles having diameters approximately 1μm and larger.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the surface potential decay of corona-charged low density polyethylene ({LDPE}) films has been investigated. It has been found that for the same sample thickness the faster decay occurs in the sample with a higher charging voltage. For the same charging voltage, the surface potential in the thinner sample shows rapid decay. Our new evidence from both the surface potential measurement on multilayer samples and space charge measurement suggests the surface potential decay is a bulk limited process. More importantly, space charge measurement indicates double injection has taken place during corona charging process.},

Distinct differences between the decay characteristics of negative and positive surface charges emerge. In the former case, the nature of the decay is shown to depend not only on the magnitude of the surface potential (700-3000 V) but also on the presence of the corona light. Corona light incident on the centre of the exposed area during charging subsequently leads to a much more rapid decay of charge in this region. In contrast, corona light has no effect on the subsequent decay of positive charges which appears to decay very much in accordance with known theories. The corona light is shown to be responsible for the so-called 'cross-over' phenomena which hitherto has been observed, notably by Ieda and co-workers (1967, 1968) after positive charging.},

To produce the surface charges, two different charging techniques were applied. One method utilised electrodes attached to the surface of the sample, the other consisted of the use of an ionisator (corona charging). Theoretical interpretation of the experimental results gives conductivities, or mobilities, and charge carrier concentrations, depending on the technique applied. The decay of surface charge is not exponential and so the half-life of the decay is not readily related to the relaxation time constant ϵ/σ. Herein is ϵ=ϵ0ϵr the total dielectric constant and σ the conductivity.},

	abstract = {In order to make droplet-based digital microfluidics really 'digital' and compatible with standard integrated chips ({ICs}), a novel low-voltage droplet manipulation method named 'liquid dielectrophoresis on electret (L-{DEPOE})' is proposed for dielectric liquids, which initializes the possibility of digital microfluidics for {IC} control and broad consumer electronic applications. By employing electret as a virtual voltage source embedded into microfluidics for the first time, a dielectric droplet between two electrodes can be transported by liquid dielectrophoresis (L-{DEP}) force when switching an external capacitor between electrodes using a manual switch or low-voltage-driven relays. A circuit model and force analysis for L-{DEPOE} are established to clarify its working principle and quantitatively depict the droplet motion. Nanoliter dielectric droplets have been transported reversibly between the two electrodes with a manual switch or five {DCV}-driven relays in microfabricated proof-of-concept prototypes. The surface voltage stability of electret in liquid is examined with different polymer materials and coatings. Furthermore, the droplet motion traces in a L-{DEPOE} device are compared with numerical simulation results, indicating the important role of contact angle hysteresis for nanoliter droplets.},

In contrast to most discussions of S-G filters, they focused on the frequency domain properties, and offered an approximate formula for the 3-{dB} cutoff frequency as a function of polynomial order N and impulse response half length M.

Reasons for the choice of design are outlined, and a formal procedure given. The performance of the technique in the presence and absence of error is studied and it is shown (a) that in the presence of error the rate of advance is inversely proportional to the error standard deviation, so that replication of observations is not beneficial, and (b) that the “efficiency” of the technique appears to increase in direct proportion to the number of factors investigated. It is also noted that, since the direction of movement from each simplex is dependent solely on the ranking of the observations, the technique may be used even in circumstances when a response cannot be quantitatively assessed. Attention is drawn to the ease with which second-order designs having the minimum number of experimental points may be derived from a regular simplex, and a fitting procedure which avoids a direct matrix inversion is suggested. In a brief appendix one or two new rotatable designs derivable from a simplex are noted.},

In the mid 1960s {GI} Taylor introduced the leaky dielectric model to explain the behavior of droplets deformed by a steady field, and {JR} Melcher used it extensively to develop electrohydrodynamics. This review deals with the foundations of the leaky dielectric model and experimental tests designed to probe its usefulness. Although the early experimental studies supported the qualitative features of the model, quantitative agreement was poor. Recent studies are in better agreement with the theory. Even though the model was originally intended to deal with sharp interfaces, contemporary studies with suspensions also agree with the theory. Clearly the leaky dielectric model is more general than originally envisioned.},

	abstract = {The streaming electrification of pure water is generally thought to be a less problem because of its high conductivity which is six orders of magnitude higher than that of a hydrocarbon liquid. However, due to the advancement of semiconductor industries, ultrapure water has been used for washing and rinsing processes and it turned out that high degree of electrification might be produced by using such ultrapure water. In order to clarify this phenomenon, the electrification of deionized water droplets dripping to and sliding on a polymer ({PTFE}) surface has been investigated. The surface potential distribution of the polymer plate after electrification is measured by moving a probe for two-dimensional scanning. The charge amount of the droplets after the sliding is measured by a Faraday cage. From these experiments, several interesting results were obtained. The potential distribution on the surface is not uniform, but varies along the streaming path. At the dripping point the surface potential of the polymer plate always becomes negative, then turns to positive downstream. However, the droplet, after sliding on the polymer surface, becomes electrified positively. This electrification phenomenon depends on the velocity and the conductivity of droplets. In order to explain this electrification process, a model based on the electric double layer is proposed.},

	abstract = {The ability to separate liquid and gas phases in the absence of a gravitational acceleration has proven a challenge to engineers since the inception of space exploration. Due to our singular experience with terrestrial systems, artificial body forces are often imparted in multiphase fluid systems aboard spacecraft to reproduce the buoyancy effect. This approach tends to be inefficient, adding complexity, resources, and failure modes. Ever present in multiphase phenomena, the forces of surface tension can be exploited to aid passive phase separations where performance characteristics are determined solely by geometric design and system wettability. Said systems may be readily designed as demonstrated herein where a regulated bubbly flow is drawn through an open triangular sectioned duct. The bubbles passively migrate toward the free surface where they coalesce and leave the flow. The tests clearly show container aspect ratios required for passive phase separations for various liquid and gas flow rates. Preliminary data are presented as regime maps demarking complete phase separation. Long duration microgravity experiments are performed aboard the International Space Station. Supplementary experiments are conducted using a drop tower.},

Recently, Coulomb orbital motion was demonstrated on the International Space Station by releasing charged water droplets in the vicinity of a charged knitting needle. In this investigation, the Multi-Sphere Method, an electrostatic model developed to study active spacecraft position control by Coulomb charging, is used to simulate the complex orbital motion of the droplets. When atmospheric drag is introduced, the simulated motion closely mimics that seen in the video footage of the experiment. The electrostatic force's inverse dependency on separation distance near the center of the needle lends itself to analytic predictions of the radial motion.},

	abstract = {Development of the Liquid Droplet Radiator  is described. Significant published results of previous investigators are presented, and work currently in progress is discussed. Several proposed {LDR} configurations are described, and the rectangular and triangular configurations currently of most interest are examined. Development of the droplet generator, collector, and auxiliary components are discussed. Radiative performance of a droplet sheet is considered, and experimental results are seen to be in very good agreement with analytical predictions. The collision of droplets in the droplet sheet, the charging of droplets by the space plasma, and the effect of atmospheric drag on the droplet sheet are shown to be of little consequence, or can be minimized by proper design. The {LDR} is seen to be less susceptible than conventional technology to the effects of micrometeoroids or hostile threats. The identification of working fluids which are stable in the orbital environments of interest is also made. Methods for reducing spacecraft contamination from an {LDR} to an acceptable level are discussed. Preliminary results of microgravity testing of the droplet generator are presented. Possible future {NASA} and Air Force missions enhanced or enabled by a {LDR} are also discussed. System studies indicate that the {LDR} is potentially less massive than heat pipe radiators. Planned microgravity testing aboard the Shuttle or space station is seen to be a logical next step in {LDR} development.},

@report{czepiela_charging_1997,
	title = {The Charging of Composites in the Space Environment},
	url = {https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19970033626},
	abstract = {Deep dielectric charging and subsequent electrostatic discharge in composite materials used on spacecraft have become greater concerns since composite materials are being used more extensively as main structural components. Deep dielectric charging occurs when high energy particles penetrate and deposit themselves in the insulating material of spacecraft components. These deposited particles induce an electric field in the material, which causes the particles to move and thus changes the electric field. The electric field continues to change until a steady state is reached between the incoming particles from the space environment and the particles moving away due to the electric field. An electrostatic discharge occurs when the electric field is greater than the dielectric strength of the composite material. The goal of the current investigation is to investigate deep dielectric charging in composite materials and ascertain what modifications have to be made to the composite properties to alleviate any breakdown issues. A 1-D model was created. The space environment, which is calculated using the Environmental Workbench software, the composite material properties, and the electric field and voltage boundary conditions are input into the model. The output from the model is the charge density, electric field, and voltage distributions as functions of the depth into the material and time. Analysis using the model show that there should be no deep dielectric charging problem with conductive composites such as carbon fiber/epoxy. With insulating materials such as glass fiber/epoxy, Kevlar, and polymers, there is also no concern of deep dielectric charging problems with average day-to-day particle fluxes. However, problems can arise during geomagnetic substorms and solar particle events where particle flux levels increase by several orders of magnitude, and thus increase the electric field in the material by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the second part of this investigation was an experimental attempt to measure the continuum electrical properties of a carbon fiber/epoxy composite, and to create a composite with tailorable conductivity without affecting its mechanical properties. The measurement of the conductivity and dielectric strength of carbon fiber/epoxy composites showed that these properties are surface layer dominated and difficult to measure. In the second experimental task, the conductivity of a glass fiber/epoxy composite was increased by 3 orders of magnitude, dielectric constant was increased approximately by a factor of 16, with minimal change to the mechanical properties, by adding conductive carbon black to the epoxy.},
